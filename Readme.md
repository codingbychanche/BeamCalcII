Beam Calc
=========
Calculates the supporting forces of a simply supported beam.

Sample output
-------------
 Beam Loads:3
 Left bearing:-2.5 N. Right bearing:-2.5 N.
 Horizontal:2.000000000000001
 Loads sorted by distance from left end of beam:
 Load 0 Distance:0.0
 Load 1 Distance:2.5
 Load 2 Distance:4.0
 Bearings sorted by distance from left end of beam:
 Bearing 0 Distance:0.0
 Bearing 1 Distance:5.0
 Max load:5.0
